# Welcome

The repository
[https://github.com/NLeSC/template](https://github.com/NLeSC/template) contains
the template for software projects at the Netherlands eScience Center. In
principle, it follows the general recommendations from https://fair-software.nl
for developing research software, while adding details that are specific to the
Netherlands eScience Center. 

When starting a new project, look for GitHub's prompt to use the template as a
starting point.

The template comes with the 5 recommendations from
[fair-software.nl](https://fair-software.nl) predefined as GitHub issues. You'll
see them as soon as you click [``New issue``](/../../issues/new/choose). For each one, click ``Get started``
to instantiate the issue from the issue template.

Once you have the 5 recommendations as issues in your issue list, feel free to
delete
- the corresponding issue templates from
[/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE)
- the Welcome section in this README.md
